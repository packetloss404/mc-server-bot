# DyoBot Rail & Bunker Map

_Snapshot generated 2026-07-01 from the live `/api/tunnel?dryRun=true` plan and
in-world terrain probes. Coordinates are Minecraft world coordinates (X, Y, Z);
north is −Z._

There are **two separate underground systems** the fleet has built:

1. **Hollybrook town rail network** — a hub-and-spoke rail tunnel under the town
   (verified carved and railed in-world).
2. **The lone bunker outpost** at (1226, 51, 524) — a real but **half-finished**
   underground shelter Maven dug ~570 blocks away. Not connected to the town rail.

---

## 1. Hollybrook town rail network

- **Central hub:** `(1700, 51, 180)` — corridor floor at **Y=51**, track at **Y=52**.
- **Corridor:** 5-tall lit tunnel (floor Y=51, ceiling Y=57), `powered_rail` every
  8 blocks (redstone block beneath), regular `rail` between, glowstone every 5 cells.
- **Topology:** hub-and-spoke — every building drops a vertical riser (stairs or
  ladder) from its floor down to the shared corridor, which runs back to the hub.
- **Verified in-world:** probes at the hub and along the corridors read
  `powered_rail` / `rail` at Y=52, matching the plan exactly.

### Entrances (walk to the doorway at ground level, go down)

| Building                 | Doorway (entrance)   | Access | Riser (shaft)        |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------|----------------------|
| Small medieval town hall | (1700, 73, 180)      | stairs | 1700/179, Y51→73     |
| Parrot statue            | (1691, 75, 180)      | ladder | 1692/180, Y51→75     |
| Victorian palace         | (1687, 64, 194)      | stairs | 1687/193, Y51→64     |
| Well                     | (1700, 63, 170)      | stairs | 1700/171, Y51→63     |
| Gnomo statue             | (1651, 64, 116)      | stairs | 1651/117, Y51→64     |
| Totem pole               | (1639, 64, 133)      | ladder | 1640/133, Y51→64     |
| Sam-cottage              | (1641, 64, 126)      | ladder | 1642/126, Y51→64     |
| Villager statue          | (1632, 64, 117)      | ladder | 1633/117, Y51→64     |

**Easiest entrances:** the town-hall staircase at **(1721, 73, 180)** (top of the
flight) or the palace staircase at **(1675, 64, 194)** — walkable stairs beat the
ladder shafts.

**Skipped:** `sam-plaque` — its corridor collided with another building's footprint,
so it has no spoke (reach it on foot from a neighbouring doorway).

### People-mover walkways (added 2026-07-01)

Every corridor now has a raised walking platform beside the rail so you can travel
on foot, not just by cart. Cross-section in the existing 5-wide tunnel: rail lane
centred, then a 2-wide platform on one side — `polished_andesite_slab` curb next to
the track + `smooth_stone_slab` deck (both bottom slabs at Y52, so the platform sits
½ block above the sunken rail, subway-style), lit by `lantern[hanging=true]` from the
Y57 ceiling every 5 blocks. Built for all 13 spoke segments by
`scratchpad/buildwalk.js` (reads the `/api/tunnel` dry-run plan). The same
cross-section is the standard for future rail (island link, bunker landing).

### Rough top-down layout (north = up, −Z)

```
        WEST  (low X) ─────────────────────────────► EAST (high X)
 z116  [villager]        [gnomo]
 z126           [sam-cottage]
 z133        [totem-pole]
   :                                   (long spokes run east to the trunk at X≈1700)
 z170                                              [well]
 z179─80                                    [town hall] ● HUB ●  [parrot]
 z194                                        [victorian palace]
```

All spokes meet at the trunk near **X≈1700**, funnelling into the hub at
**(1700, 51, 180)**.

### Rebuild / preview / extend

```bash
# Preview the current plan (no world contact, no bot needed):
curl -s -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/tunnel?dryRun=true' | jq .

# Actually carve/repair (needs confirm:true and a connected op bot):
curl -s -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/tunnel?confirm=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

`floorOffset` (query or body, ≥6, default 12) sets how far below building floors the
corridor sits. The build runs a verify-and-repair sweep after carving.

## 1b. Island-HQ link (COMPLETE 2026-07-02)

Town hub **(1700,51,180)** ⟷ island HQ **(1559,64,-392)**, ~690 blocks, verified
rail-continuous end to end (every block probed, 0 gaps).

- **Leg 1 (north):** x=1700, z157 → z-390. Stone shell, town standard cross-section
  (5-wide, rail centered Y52, walkway on the east side x1701 curb / x1702 deck,
  hanging lanterns).
- **Corner junction:** (1700, 52, -390), fully shelled + railed.
- **Leg 2 (west):** z=-390, x1699 → x1563, stone_bricks shell (runs under the island),
  walkway on the south side (z-389 curb / z-388 deck). Buffer cap at x1562.
- **HQ terminus station:** powered launch strip at (1564–1565, 52, -390); sunken grand
  staircase branching south off the walkway — doorway in the corridor's south wall at
  (1566–1568, z-387), stone-brick steps rising z-386→-377 (Y53→Y62), stone-brick
  landing + entrance arch with lanterns surfacing on the lawn at **(1566–1568, 63,
  -376)**, just SE of the warehouse (bedrock-roofed, x1554–1564 z-400..-386). Signed
  at the platform ("50ELEVEN HQ STATION") and at the surface arch.
- The corridor's west end passes directly under the warehouse; the staircase site was
  chosen east of it to avoid touching any HQ structure.
- Undocumented **east stub** on Z=180: rail continuous x1700→1723 at Y52, unrailed
  corridor floor to x1725, solid from x1726. Dead-end leftover from Stage A staging —
  harmless, protected, leave intact.

## 2. The lone bot-dig at (1226, 51, 524) — REMOVED

**Status: REAL but incomplete.** Built by **Maven** (merchant) in a single ~40-min
session on **2026-05-26** (05:24–06:04 UTC). This is a separate shelter, *not* part
of the Hollybrook rail network, though its own "rail tunnel capital shaft" shares the
same corridor depth (Y≈51).

Reconstructed from `data/skill_attribution.json` usage history:

| Step                         | Skill                                   | Result |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| Travel to site               | `travelToBunker`                        | ✅     |
| Stock food                   | `collectFoodForBunker`                  | ✅     |
| Iron door at entrance        | `placeIronDoorAtBunker`                 | ✅     |
| Interior torches             | `illuminateBunker`                      | ✅     |
| Crafting table inside        | `placeCraftingTableInBunker`            | ❌     |
| Furnace inside               | `placeFurnaceInBunker`                  | ❌     |
| Beds inside                  | `placeBedsInBunker`                     | ❌     |
| Keep it buried + rails intact| `ensureBunkerUndergroundAndRailsIntact` | ❌     |

**So the bunker exists** (dug out, iron door, food, lit) but is **unfinished**: no
crafting station, furnace, or beds, and the "still underground / rails undamaged"
check failed — its shaft or rails may be **exposed or damaged**.

**Not independently verified in-world** as of this snapshot: no bot is near (1226,524),
so its chunk is unloaded and can't be scanned remotely. To confirm/finish it, send a
bot there first (e.g. an explorer), then re-scan.

> These 8 bunker skills only exist as reputation/usage entries — there is **no saved
> skill code** for them in `skills/index.json`. They were one-shot codegen attempts,
> not durable library skills. Kept (not purged) because they are the only record that
> this outpost exists.

## Note: terrain-scan fix (2026-07-01)

`GET /api/terrain` (the block-grid heightmap) previously picked the **first**
connected bot as its probe, not the **nearest** one. If that bot was far from the
scan target, every block read back as `air` (out-of-view chunks → `blockAt` null →
treated as air), producing all-air garbage. Fixed to pick the bot closest to the
scan column (matching `/api/terrain/height`). See `src/server/routes/terrainRoutes.ts`.
